line plot -> it is one of the Basic types of Data Visualization
used to show how values change over a Sequence.

x/y-axis  -> it shows Hz and Vertical Data ploting
Axes -> Graph box , actual area that Plots the Graph.

plot -> the final result Seen
marker->symbol or dot
line style->how lines are drawn in Graph

Color-> color of line, marker
legend-> it shows which line represent what
label -> to explain what x and y axis doing

matlpotlib Object oriented Api -> an explicit and structured approach to
creating visualizations by directly managing the individual components of a plot as objects

functions
plt.plot-> to draw a plot
# plt.plot(x, y, color='color name', linestyle = 'line_style',linewidth = value, marker='marker symbol', label='label name')

plt.legend -> it explain about the graph in samll rectangualr box.
plt.grid ->hz & vert lines add karta behind the graph 

plt.xlim -> it can control limit of x ranges
plt.ylim ->it can control limit of y ranges

plt.xticks ->used to replace the x-axis ranges with other
plt.yticks ->used to replace the y-axis ranges with other


barchart-> category comparison & Data Analysis
Pie chart-> proportion illustration whole representation
histogram -> Numerical Distribution Data Insights

scatter plot -> observe and display the relationship, or correlation,
between two different numerical variables. 

subplot is useful to compare Multiple charts
-> Space bachega
->quickly analyse releated Database.
